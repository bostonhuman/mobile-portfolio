        <strong>On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals.</strong> As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.

        <p>A toy named Woody has it all. He is practically the leader in Andy's toy room, Bo Peep has the hots for him, and most importantly, he is Andy's favorite toy. But when the clocks strike Andy's birthday, a new toy arrives. Buzz Lightyear, a space cadet who thinks he is a space ranger, (not a toy in a room) instantly wins over Andy, thus becoming Andy's new treasure.</p>

        <img src="img/toy6.jpg">

        <p>But when Woody is accused of knocking Buzz out of the window, he must go into the world and find Buzz, with many delays...A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room.</p>
